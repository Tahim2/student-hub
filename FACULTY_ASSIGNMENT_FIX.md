# Faculty Course Assignment - CSRF Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. CSRF Token Mismatch Error
**Problem**: The admin course assignment form was showing "Error saving assignment: CSRF token mismatch" when trying to create new faculty assignments.

**Root Cause**: 
- The JavaScript `saveAssignment()` function was not properly handling the CSRF token
- FormData was not including the CSRF token from the `@csrf` directive
- Error handling was not providing clear debugging information

**Solution**:
- Updated the `saveAssignment()` function in `/resources/views/admin/course-assignments/index-new.blade.php`
- Ensured CSRF token is properly included from the meta tag
- Improved error handling to show actual server responses
- Added proper loading states for the save button

### 2. Course Model Field Names
**Problem**: Admin view was trying to access `$assignment->course->code` and `$assignment->course->name` but the Course model uses `course_code` and `course_name`.

**Solution**:
- Fixed the admin view to use correct field names: `course_code` and `course_name`

### 3. Controller Debugging
**Problem**: Lack of logging made it difficult to debug assignment creation issues.

**Solution**:
- Added comprehensive logging to the `CourseAssignmentController@store` method
- Log all request data, CSRF tokens, and any errors
- Better error messages for debugging
